# Introduction
In this project, we take on the role of the a **Senior Data Analyst** at ThomasTrain company and our goal is to analyse customer satisfaction in the company which would ultimately help the marketing team in increasing customer retention through targeted promotions. We are provided the “trains_dataset.csv” dataset to use for our analysis which provides a comprehensive set of features that encompass customer demographics, service ratings, travel-related information, and more. These features serve as valuable inputs for analyzing and predicting customer satisfaction.
